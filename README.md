# question_solver_AI

question_solver is a simple script written in python that, by using the API from OpenAI,
generates answers to questions (contained in the questions.txt file) and saves them in the result.txt file.

## usage
The first thing you need to do to use the script is to download your own API key from the OpenAI portal, and put it in line 6 of main.py
```python
token = "<YOUR-API-TOKEN-HERE>"
```

The second step is to create a questions.txt file, which will contain the questions.

!!!NOTE!!!
ONE LINE IN THE FILE IS ONE QUESTION!!!
(Sample file included in the repository)

## Contributing

You can rework the script as you wish, the way of reading and writing is up to you (I wanted to work out quickly). The only thing I ask is not to sell this "masterpiece", just make this repository available. Pull requests are possible, but I do not know if I will remember it.
